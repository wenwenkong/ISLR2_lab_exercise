## Repository for archiving the labs and exercises of ISLR2.

- ISLR2 = An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Second Edition. 

- The [ISLR2 website](https://www.statlearning.com/) includes all resources you need to follow the course.

## Specifics of this repo

### Note
For both `lab` and `exercise` folders:

    - .Rmd is the raw R markdown 
    
    - .md is the rendered markdown after Knitting the .Rmd to github document
    
    - the subfolders contains the saved figures during the knitting processes, they will be used by the .md for the rendering purpose

1. `lab` 
Each chapter from chapters 2 to 13 in ISLR2 comes with a R lab section. The raw lab files were provided on the ISLR2 website. I added a few comments here and there when I was following the labs. 

2. `exercise` 
Each chapter from chapters 2 to 13 includes an exercise section, which is grouped into two parts: conceptual exercise and applied exercise. Files in this `exercise` folder are my solutions to the applied exercise, with solutions to each chapter saved in separate files. All current solutions are provided in R. I hope to provide python solutions as well at a later point. 
    - Note: current files in this fold only include descriptions of the problem sets. Solutions will be updated gradually.

3. `data` 
All data files needed for lab and exercise. These data files were downloaded from ISLR2.
